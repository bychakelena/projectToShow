My first project
( let's learn how to work with github )

I've cloned the repo

I've changed the personage image

I've changed the route

I've changed the route points image

Then I indexed changes and commit them

Then I created repo on github

Set this repo as remote

Pushed my commit from local master branch to remote

Then created gh-pages branch on remote

Published my mini-project and enjoyed
